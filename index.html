          <p>
            The hardware requirements to install FreeBSD vary by architecture.
            Hardware architectures and devices supported by a FreeBSD release
            are listed on the FreeBSD Release Information page. The FreeBSD
            download page also has recommendations for choosing the correct
            image for different architectures.
          </p>
          <p>
            A FreeBSD installation requires a minimum of 96 MB of RAM and 1.5 GB
            of free hard drive space. However, such small amounts of memory and
            disk space are really only suitable for custom applications like
            embedded appliances. General-purpose desktop systems need more
            resources. 2-4 GB RAM and at least 8 GB hard drive space is a good
            starting point.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>amd64</span>
            This is the most common desktop and laptop processor type, used in
            most modern systems. Intel® calls it Intel64. Other manufacturers
            sometimes call it x86-64. Examples of amd64 compatible processors
            include: AMD Athlon™64, AMD Opteron™, multi-core Intel® Xeon™, and
            Intel® Core™ 2 and later processors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>i386</span>
            Older desktops and laptops often use this 32-bit, x86 architecture.
            Almost all i386-compatible processors with a floating point unit are
            supported. All Intel® processors 486 or higher are supported.
            However, binaries released by the project are compiled for the 686
            processor, so a special build will be needed for 486 and 586
            systems. FreeBSD will take advantage of Physical Address Extensions
            (PAE) support on CPUs with this feature. A kernel with the PAE
            feature enabled will detect memory above 4 GB and allow it to be
            used by the system. However, using PAE places constraints on device
            drivers and other features of FreeBSD.

          <h3>Booting on i386™ and amd64</h3>
          <p>
            These architectures provide a BIOS menu for selecting the boot
            device. Depending upon the installation media being used, select the
            CD/DVD or USB device as the first boot device. Most systems also
            provide a key for selecting the boot device during startup without
            having to enter the BIOS. Typically, the key is either F10, F11,
            F12, or Escape.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The installation media was not inserted early enough in the boot
              process. Leave the media inserted and try restarting the computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The BIOS changes were incorrect or not saved. Double-check that
              the right boot device is selected as the first boot device.
            </li>
            <li>
              This system is too old to support booting from the chosen media.
              In this case, the Plop Boot Manager
              (http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html) can be used to boot the
              system from the selected media.
            </li>

      <section class="main-section" id="basics">
        <header><h2>basics</h2></header>

        <h3>Virtual Consoles and Terminals</h3>
        <p>
          Unless FreeBSD has been configured to automatically start a graphical
          environment during startup, the system will boot into a command line
          login prompt, as seen in this example:
        </p>
        <code> FreeBSD/amd64 (pc3.example.org) (ttyv0) login: </code>

        <h3>Changing Console Video Modes</h3>
        <p>
          The FreeBSD console default video mode may be adjusted to 1024x768,
          1280x1024, or any other size supported by the graphics chip and
          monitor. To use a different video mode load the VESA module:
        </p>
        <code> # kldload vesa </code>
        <p>
          To determine which video modes are supported by the hardware, use
          vidcontrol(1). To get a list of supported video modes issue the
          following:
        </p>
        <code> # vidcontrol -i mode </code>
        <p>
          The output of this command lists the video modes that are supported by
          the hardware. To select a new video mode, specify the mode using
          vidcontrol(1) as the root user:
        </p>
        <code> # vidcontrol MODE_279 </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="disks_organisation">
        <header><h2>disks organisation</h2></header>
        <p>
          The smallest unit of organization that FreeBSD uses to find files is
          the filename. Filenames are case-sensitive, which means that
          readme.txt and README.TXT are two separate files. FreeBSD does not use
          the extension of a file to determine whether the file is a program,
          document, or some other form of data.
        </p>
        <h3>Processes and Daemons</h3>
        <p>
          FreeBSD is a multi-tasking operating system. Each program running at
          any one time is called a process. Every running command starts at
          least one new process and there are a number of system processes that
          are run by FreeBSD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each process is uniquely identified by a number called a process ID
          (PID). Similar to files, each process has one owner and group, and the
          owner and group permissions are used to determine which files and
          devices the process can open. Most processes also have a parent
          process that started them. For example, the shell is a process, and
          any command started in the shell is a process which has the shell as
          its parent process. The exception is a special process called init(8)
          which is always the first process to start at boot time and which
          always has a PID of 1.

        <h3>Finding the System Hardware</h3>
        <p>
          Before editing the kernel configuration file, it is recommended to
          perform an inventory of the machine’s hardware. On a dual-boot system,
          the inventory can be created from the other operating system. For
          example, Microsoft®'s Device Manager contains information about
          installed devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If FreeBSD is the only installed operating system, use dmesg(8) to
          determine the hardware that was found and listed during the boot
          probe. Most device drivers on FreeBSD have a manual page which lists
          the hardware supported by that driver. For example, the following
          lines indicate that the psm(4) driver found a mouse:
        </p>
        <code>
          psm0: <PS/2 Mouse> irq 12 on atkbdc0 psm0: [GIANT-LOCKED] psm0:
          [ITHREAD] psm0: model Generic PS/2 mouse, device ID 0
        </code>
        <p>
          Since this hardware exists, this driver should not be removed from a
          custom kernel configuration file. If the output of dmesg does not
          display the results of the boot probe output, instead read the
          contents of /var/run/dmesg.boot. Another tool for finding hardware is
          pciconf(8), which provides more verbose output. For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          % pciconf -lv ath0@pci0:3:0:0: class=0x020000 card=0x058a1014
          chip=0x1014168c rev=0x01 hdr=0x00 vendor = 'Atheros Communications
          Inc.' device = 'AR5212 Atheros AR5212 802.11abg wireless' class =
          network subclass = ethernet
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="security">
        <header><h2>security</h2></header>
        <p>
          ecurity, whether physical or virtual, is a topic so broad that an
          entire industry has evolved around it. Hundreds of standard practices
          have been authored about how to secure systems and networks, and as a
          user of FreeBSD, understanding how to protect against attacks and
          intruders is a must. In this chapter, several fundamentals and
          techniques will be discussed. The FreeBSD system comes with multiple
          layers of security, and many more third party utilities may be added
          to enhance security.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Security is everyone’s responsibility. A weak entry point in any
          system could allow intruders to gain access to critical information
          and cause havoc on an entire network. One of the core principles of
          information security is the CIA triad, which stands for the
          Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CIA triad is a bedrock concept of computer security as customers
          and users expect their data to be protected. For example, a customer
          expects that their credit card information is securely stored
          (confidentiality), that their orders are not changed behind the scenes
          (integrity), and that they have access to their order information at
          all times (availability).
